					<description><![CDATA[Ha. No, it&#039;s not a lent thing. I read some good pseudo-science in the NYTimes magazine a couple of weekends ago. A dermotologist basically said &quot;give up coffee for six weeks and switch to green tea and you&#039;ll notice a difference in your health&quot; so even though I&#039;m incredibly sceptical, I&#039;m giving it a try in the name of SCIENCE. I loves me some good SCIENCE.

Thanks for the luck! Week 2 and still going strong. I&#039;ll have to look for the Morning Thunder next time I&#039;m at the grocery store. Is it herbal or black or a mixture? The green tea is easy for me since we have it as part of the selection of nice free teas here at work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is this a Lent thing?  Interesting to note something -- technically, if you look at the the idea of lent as presented in the Bible, it is a 40 day &quot;fast&quot; from something -- and if you actually count it correctly, it is the 40 days from Ash Wedensday to Easter -- NOT including Sundays.  Technically, you can have what you gave up for lent on Sundays -- just most people don&#039;t bother to understand what they are doing.

But, since you started on a Monday, it probably isn&#039;t a Lent thing.  Good Luck!

Tip:  To really get things going, skip the green tea, and move right to Celestial Seasonings &quot;Morning Thunder!&quot;]]></description>
