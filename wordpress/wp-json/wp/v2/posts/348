Kind of like Orangeparade! I can&#8217;t remember the last time I fed my starter. I can say with certainty that I haven&#8217;t fed it since June. I may not have touched the sourdough since before Passover. Crazy! I know. <\/p>\n<p>It was with some trepidation that I decided to attempt to revive my starter. When I took off the cover there was about 3\/4 inch of black liquid on top, but that&#8217;s perfectly normal for starter that&#8217;s been sitting around for awhile. It didn&#8217;t have a pink or orange tint or any of the &#8220;off&#8221; smells you&#8217;re supposed to watch out for. I poured off the liquid, scraped the top in to the trash, and put about a cup of clean-looking old starter in a glass bowl. I added 4 oz of water and 4 oz of KA AP flour, mixed well and let it sit for a few hours on the counter. Lo and behold, it bubbled (a little). I stirred the bowl &#038; tossed half of the starter mixture, then fed it again with 4 oz of water and 4 oz of flour and let it sit for a few more hours. That time it bubbled even more, so I considered the experiment a success.<\/p>\n<p>I took out 9 oz of starter to make some sourdough bread (dough is rising in the fridge, will report back later) and fed the remaining starter with 4 &#038; 4, mixed &#038; popped in the fridge. Fingers crossed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sourdough starter is surprisingly resilient to neglect. Kind of like Orangeparade!
