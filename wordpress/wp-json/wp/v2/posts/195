Partly because I was just in the mood to make soup and partly because, well, I do have a lot of vegetables around the house. I made celeriac potato soup, pumpkin soup, and roasted beet soup. <\/p>\n<p>I started the day off with the celeriac potato soup. One book had suggested that celeriac should be peeled with a pairing knife, but I peeled the celeriac with my favorite vegetable peeler and that worked quite well for me. The potatoes I had were on the small side, which made for a lot of peeling. I lightly sauteed a diced onion for a few minutes, then added the celeriac and sauteed for a few minutes more. Then I added the potato chunks, about 6 cups of water and seasoned with salt and pepper. When the potatoes and celeriac were tender, I blended everything together with my trusty stick blender.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2010740044\/\" title=\"celeriac potato soup by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2360\/2010740044_9a346ad02e_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"celeriac potato soup\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2009940107\/\" title=\"celeriac potato soup by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2114\/2009940107_b97b345508_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"celeriac potato soup\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Since my large Le Creuset was busy with the celeriac potato soup, I decided to make the pumpkin soup in the pressure cooker.

I sauteed the onion in the pressure cooker and added the pumpkin after a few minutes. I added water until the 2\/3 mark in my cooker and closed the lid. I brought it up to high pressure and cooked for about 10 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release. Once the mix had cooled, I blended it up with the stick blender and seasoned with salt and pepper. This time I left out the dairy because I was planning to freeze the soup.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2009939789\/\" title=\"pressure cooker by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2283\/2009939789_8b16a1995d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"pressure cooker\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2010740864\/\" title=\"roasted beets by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2243\/2010740864_4c003a5c52_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"roasted beets\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The last soup I made was the roasted beet soup, adapted from Mark Bittman&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHow-Cook-Everything-Vegetarian-Meatless%2Fdp%2F0764524836%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1195244909%26sr%3D8-1&#038;tag=orangeparade-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325\">How to Cook Everything Vegetarian<\/a><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=orangeparade-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/>. While it was the last soup to hit the stove, it was actually started first because the first thing I did in the morning was peel the beets (messy, but fun) and roast them with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Once the beets were roasted, they hung out on the counter until I was ready to make the soup. <\/p>\n<p>If memory serves me, the soup started with sauteed onions as most good soups do. In the meantime, I was busy as a bee chopping up the roasted beets in to small pieces. I added the chopped beets to the pan after cooking the onions for about 15 minutes and then followed with water. The directions had the soup cooking for a half an hour or so, but I found that it took much longer to get it to a consistency that I liked. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2009938803\/\" title=\"chopping up beets by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2030\/2009938803_972fe3da17_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"chopping up beets\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2010737448\/\" title=\"roasted beet soup by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2212\/2010737448_3667b99aee_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"roasted beet soup\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day I packed all of the soup into plastic containers for the freezer. The freezer is full. It does not want me to put any more soup in it. I will probably keep trying my hand at freezer tetris.
