I made a big container of hummus and brought along a bunch of pita. There was a good selection of items for the potluck luncheon and I liked everything that I tried. There was a pig roast as well, which I didn&#8217;t partake in, though I did take a lot of pictures of it. Quite a novelty. I have all the pictures from the farm up in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orangeparade.com\/gallery\/v\/Farm2006\/\">photogallery<\/a>.<br \/>\nWe took a hay-less hayride around the fields and then we took a walking tour through the field with Deb, the woman who runs the farm. It was pretty awesome. After the tour, she casually mentions that we should feel free to pick anything we like. Holy moly. We ended up with 8 pounds of tomatoes (not pretty, but perfect for sauce), 9 pounds of eggplant (firm and perfect), 4 pounds of mixed peppers and 5 leeks. Saturday night I was up until 1:30 making roasted peppers, tomato sauce, indian-spiced eggplant and roasted ratatouille.  Delicious! Jeremie took a bunch of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orangeparade.com\/gallery\/v\/PostFarmCooking\/\">pictures<\/a> while I was cooking.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday we drove almost 2 hours in the other direction to Glastonbury, CT to go kayaking with friends. It was a beautiful day, a bit on the chilly and windy side, but sunny and gorgeous overall. Kayaking was a blast and I&#8217;d love to go up there again. After kayaking we visited a Priam Vineyards, a local winery, and had a nice time tasting their wines. Then we popped back into the car and headed to a farm near our friends&#8217; house, hoping to u-pick some peaches before dinner. Unfortunatly, the u-pick part of the farm closed before we got there but the store was open and we ended up getting a medium-sized basket of white peaches (around 6 lbs) and a jumbo basket of Macintosh apples (20ish lbs). Pies and applesauce, applesauce, applesauce. Because I don&#8217;t have enough to do!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saturday morning we drove 2 hours north (up 87) to Stoneledge Farm for their 10th anniversary members potluck.
