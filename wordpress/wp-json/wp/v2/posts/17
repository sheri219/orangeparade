Rain, rain, rain.  Apparently it&#8217;s hurricane remnants. I&#8217;m a big fan of hurricane remnants as opposed to actual hurricanes.  I could not handle that kind of stress. Yeesh. <\/p>\n<p>Jeremie and I had a great weekend in Minneapolis with the fam. I did some baking with my Grandma and made her a bunch of soup for the freezer. I love making soup.  We went to the &#8220;Great Minnesota Get-Together&#8221; (a.k.a. the State Fair) with my cousins and my auntie and ate a proper minnesotan variety of fried foods including my favorite, fried dill pickles. I have a bunch of pictures of the butter heads and baby animals to put up, which I&#8217;ll try to do tonight. I haven&#8217;t been in the mood these past couple days to do much computing once I get home. <\/p>\n<p>Last night I made a soup with yellow mung dal and sweet potatoes. It is very tasty. I also made my tasty tuscan bean spread but accidentally put too much salt in so I&#8217;ll have to figure something out. I&#8217;m hoping that the salt will mellow given a day in the fridge but if it doesn&#8217;t, i&#8217;ll just combine it with another can of beans and we&#8217;ll have bean spread sandwiches all weekend.  The other thing I did last night was talk to Shana for the first time in well over a year and that was very, very nice.  I emailed her yesterday afternoon to tell her about an old friend of ours that had a baby boy on Tuesday and she called me back. Three cheers for old friends. Hi Shana. <\/p>\n<p>I need to go get some yarn and make some baby hats. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m happy that our lawn got a trimming Tuesday while we were at work because it&#8217;s been raining non-stop since then and it would be looking pretty jungle-crazy right now.
