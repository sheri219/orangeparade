I still have two zucchini left over from last week. For Friday night dinner I made a dish with whole wheat couscous, red onion, pesto, a Zephyr squash and one of the new zucchinis. For lunch today I had a steamed Zephyr squash. This still leaves me with 11 squash in the fridge. It&#8217;s far too hot to bake or cook anything right now but I need to get busy tonight. For dinner I&#8217;m planning on making a take off of this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/everydayfood\/recipes\/Pasta_Salad_with_Broccoli_and_Peanuts.html\">Pasta Salad with Broccoli and Peanuts<\/a>. Instead of the broccoli I&#8217;m going to put in some carrots, zucchini, the perpetual spinach, and the snow peas. I don&#8217;t have any peanuts so I&#8217;m going to use chunky peanut butter for the dressing, which would be more clever if I had creamy peanut butter as well as chunky, which I don&#8217;t.  If it cools down enough to run the oven tonight, I&#8217;m going to make my Mom&#8217;s spinach vegetable kugel, with zucchini instead of spinach. I made that substitution last year and it was quite tasty. If I still have any squash left then I might make a zucchini bread\/cake thing. <\/p>\n<p>According to the latest email from the farmers, we&#8217;re getting 15 summer squash next week. Oh dear.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Due to the July 4 holiday our CSA share was delivered on Thursday, not Wednesday.
