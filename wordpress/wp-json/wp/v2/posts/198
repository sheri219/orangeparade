This is a great thing. As a result of years of rationing and meticulously planning out my vacation days, I was still subconsciously rationing my time this year and I found myself at the beginning of December with a bunch of days to use or lose. I took off the previous two Fridays and I&#8217;m taking off all of next week and the following Monday. <\/p>\n<p>The Friday before last I made a delightful selection of vegetarian dishes for Shabbat but I decided to kick it up a notch this Friday and make challah. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2130906831\/\" title=\"Whole Wheat Challah by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2145\/2130906831_3f1bdf6666.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Whole Wheat Challah\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my recipe for whole wheat challah. This recipe makes a stickyish dough and does well as a pull-apart challah. You might want to add a bit more flour if you&#8217;re planning on making braids.<\/p>\n<p>2 packages dry yeast (4 1\/2 t)<br \/>\n2 cups warm water<br \/>\n1 tsp sugar<br \/>\n1\/2 C honey<br \/>\n1\/2 C sugar<br \/>\n2 eggs<br \/>\n1 Tbsp oil<br \/>\n2 1\/2 C whole wheat flour<br \/>\n3 3\/4 C all purpose flour<br \/>\nglaze : 1 egg, beaten<\/p>\n<p>In a bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar and let stand for 2 minutes. Add oil, honey, eggs and mix well. Gradually add flour, 2 cups at a time mixing after each addition. When just combined, let mixture rest for 15 minutes. Knead for 8 minutes. Let rise in reased bowl until double in size, about 1 hour. Separate dough in to two parts, shape* and place on greased pan\/baking sheet. Allow to rise again until doubled in size, about 1\/2 hour. <\/p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush loaves with glaze and sprinkle with seeds if desired. Bake 30-45 minutes until brown. Remove from pans and cool on racks.<\/p>\n<p>*if you want to make a pull-apart challah, grease two round baking pans. I used 8 inch cake rounds. Make a bunch of balls out of the dough and place them in the greased pan. With an 8 inch round you&#8217;ll probably only get one layer of balls.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year I had more than double the vacation days that I had last year, due to a company-wide policy change.
