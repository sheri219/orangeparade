Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I made a few salads with the red sails lettuce and I still have the head of buttercrunch to finish. A wee bit of a problem since we&#8217;re getting two more heads today. I still haven&#8217;t used the scallions or potatoes, but they&#8217;ll keep so I&#8217;m not worried. The edamame we just ate, after steaming it in the microwave. Tomatoes: some were eaten sliced plain, some sliced with fresh mozzarella, good bread, and basil, some went in to salads, a couple were chopped and added to a second batch of eggplant gnocchi, I made a fresh tomato soup with several, and I have a couple left. I forgot to mention that on top of the 6 pounds of tomatoes from the CSA, I easily had another 6+ pounds from my garden. It&#8217;s tomato time. Cherry tomatoes we popped like candy, pretty much the same with the lipstick peppers. They&#8217;re so sweet and delicious. The apples were incredible and we ate all of them by the end of the weekend. I still have a handful of pears and plums left that I&#8217;ll need to do something with.
