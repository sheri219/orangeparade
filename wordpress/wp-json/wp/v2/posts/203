The taste was there but the crust was on the soft size. Baking on a baking sheet is very easy, especially when it comes to shaping the loaves, but it doesn&#8217;t get you a perfect crust. The next round of this same bread will be on my baking stone or in my 5qt Le Creuset round. I&#8217;m not yet convinced that a cloche baker is worth the investment. They&#8217;re not terribly expensive but there&#8217;s lots of reports out there that they break pretty quickly. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2294185978\/\" title=\"Chocolate Chunk Sourdough by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2101\/2294185978_a230a32fe6.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Chocolate Chunk Sourdough\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I did not do any additional baking this week because most of my time was taken up preparing for The Party. What was The Party, you ask? The Party was for my birthday and Jeremie&#8217;s birthday. It was our first Big Party in this house (we&#8217;ve lived here 5 years) and the first we&#8217;ve had in a very long time. Last night we had about 30 people over and a good time was had by all. On the savory side we had veggies &#038; spinach dip, hummus and pitas, salsa, black bean dip, guacamole, and tortilla chips, tapenade, crackers, and a variety of cheeses, spinach pies, mozzarella cheese sticks, and garlic cheese crostini. For the sweet stuff we had my sweet &#038; spicy pecans, peanut and regular M&#038;Ms, a big birthday sheet cake, and a giant chocolate torte. The drink options were too numerous to enumerate. Needless to say, we have a lot of leftovers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Sunday I baked two breads: Seeded Sourdough and Chocolate Chunk Sourdough I was trying to get close to Zingerman&#8217;s Chocolate Sourdough bread.
