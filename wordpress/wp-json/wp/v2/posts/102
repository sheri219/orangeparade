Jeremie and I went into the city last night to see Mike Doughty&#8217;s Band at Webster Hall and we went a wee bit early so we could grab some dinner. It was windy, rainy and bitter cold but that didn&#8217;t stop us from getting over to Momofuku on 1st ave between 11th &#038; 10th.  I&#8217;d been wanting to check it out and it did not disappoint.<br \/>\nThe hit of the night was the &#8220;chicken bun&#8221; &#8211; not quite like your traditional chinese bun but I liked it better. Instead of being a closed packet with a little meat inside, the outside part was oblong-shaped and was folded over the delectible filling. Ours contained a wonderful plum sauce with thin slices of cucumber and the most tender, yet crispy, chicken meat.  The second favorite was the spicy chicken wings, followed by our noodle dishes. It&#8217;s not that the noodles weren&#8217;t fantastic, but the chicken buns were so out there that they skewed everything else. We&#8217;ll definitely be back.<br \/>\nWe got to Webster Hall on the early side, which was fine because we were able to find a seat. Our friends were not far behind us and fabulous conversation was had by all. Then came the opener, Orenda Fink. Oh my dear. If you&#8217;re looking for music to inflict-bodily-harm-on-yourself to, she&#8217;s your gal. We were very ready for her to stop singing not too long after she started.<br \/>\nThankfully she only did like 6 or 7 songs and then we got Mike Doughty and his band. They played a very good show, lots of fun, a variety of stuff.  I could sing along and I could actually *see* for once, which was very very nice in my book. <\/p>\n<p>I am hungry. Breakfast time. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The good eats keep on coming!
