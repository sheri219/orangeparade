I baked a ton of stuff over the weekend and the past couple of days but I didn&#8217;t take any pictures because A) I&#8217;m silly, and B) I didn&#8217;t want to slow down. Here&#8217;s what I made: lemon bars, chocolate mint brownies, cream cheese brownies, peanut butter cookies, molasses spice jumbles, and yellow cake baby bundt cakes. I also baked for the Relay for Life bake sale that we&#8217;re having at work tomorrow. For that I made Chocolate-Apricot cake (a dense, fudgy torte) and a yellow cake baked in a Mary Anne pan, which I&#8217;ll fill with a raspberry jam &#038; raspberry liqueur mixture. I expect there will be some cookies &#038; things left over from the CSA meeting that I can bring to the bake sale. <\/p>\n<p>I got a new camera today, a Canon 800IS, so expect some new pretty pictures soon.  I&#8217;m leaving for Israel on Saturday and I will do my best to eat as much falafel as possible and to photograph every one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been holding off on posting, hoping that I could finish my Paris travelogue, but it doesn&#8217;t look likely to happen any time soon.
