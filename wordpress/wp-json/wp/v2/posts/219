It was kind of, sort of, cool enough on Sunday for me to justify turning on the oven to bake bread.<br \/>\nI mixed up the sponge Sunday morning and had just enough AP flour to do it. I saw King Arthur AP at Trader Joe&#8217;s earlier in the week for $3.99\/bag but I foolishly didn&#8217;t buy it. At the Grade A, all their King Arthur flour was $4.99\/5 LB bag. I am quite curious as to how\/why TJ is selling it for so much less. Anyway. Since all the flour was the same price, I decided to try the King Arthur bread flour. Given that these loaves are about 65% AP and 35% bread flour, I can&#8217;t vouch yet for the performance of the bread flour, but these loaves turned out very well. Good sourdough flavor and a good crumb. Not too holey, which is good for sandwiches. The warm house was good for dough rising. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2607803417\/\" title=\"Sourdough by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3239\/2607803417_25c0645cd5.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"278\" alt=\"Sourdough\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On a recommendation from Bill, I got &#8220;The Perfect Scoop&#8221; by David Lebovitz out from the Library last week.
