I got back from San Francisco last Wednesday in plenty of time to pick up the share, but I was way too exhausted to do anything other than take pictures and put the vegetables away. Plus, it was Halloween and I needed to hand out candy far more than I needed to cook. Thursday evening I made a delicious pumpkin soup out of the pie pumpkins I&#8217;ve had sitting around for a few weeks. It&#8217;s definitely a make again soup. For Friday night dinner I made my spinach vegetable kugel but used collards and kale instead of spinach, which worked out quite well. Tonight I&#8217;m planning to make a big &#8220;everything&#8221; vegetable soup to try and use up whatever is left in the fridge before the new stuff comes tomorrow. We still have a lot of fruit too, so I might need to make another batch of pressure cooker pears (they come out like poached pears but it&#8217;s super quick to do) and maybe some applesauce too. If only I actually had room in the freezer. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 20<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1829132627\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2003\/1829132627_e6ca0a43a1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Week 20 - Veg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Potatoes-2 pounds<br \/>\nOnions-4<br \/>\nBeets-2 pounds<br \/>\nDelicata-2<br \/>\nTurnips with Greens-1<br \/>\nCollards-1 bunch<br \/>\nParsley-1 bunch<br \/>\nBlack Radish-1<br \/>\nRomanesco-1<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1829132843\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2252\/1829132843_83bd2f34f3.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Week 20 - Fruit\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Mutsu-green apple, multi purpose<br \/>\nBosc Pears-rusty brown pear, multi purpose<br \/>\nEmpire Apples-small, red really crispy-good eating<br \/>\nJona Gold Apples-large, red and gold tinge-good cooking<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 21<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1829133053\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2258\/1829133053_24b5102a5c.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Week 21 - Veg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Garlic-2<br \/>\nWinterbor Kale-1 bunch<br \/>\nCarrots-2 pounds<br \/>\nGreen Winter Cabbage-1 head<br \/>\nRed Ace Beets-2 pounds<br \/>\nCarnival Winter Squash-1<br \/>\nMint-1 bunch<br \/>\nCelariac-2 bulbs<br \/>\nGraffiti Cauliflower-1<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1829133209\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2020\/1829133209_f758c81793.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Week 21 - Fruit\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>APPLES: Jona Gold, Fuji, Golden Delicious; Bosc Pears<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, I&#8217;ve been on the go a lot lately.
