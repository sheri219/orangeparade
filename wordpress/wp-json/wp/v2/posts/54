Supposedly it&#8217;s going to be 10 below tonight, which is rare around here. I&#8217;d better make sure that the heat is on in the basement. I&#8217;ll be exercising from home tonight if it&#8217;s that cold. <\/p>\n<p>Speaking of exercising, I&#8217;m taking it up to a new level of science. Last week I tried spinning with Jeremie&#8217;s heart rate monitor and since I could monitor myself and stop before I got sick, it was a much more pleasant experience. I discovered, to my surprise, that it&#8217;s really easy to go way above my target heart rate while spinning.  So, I ordered the Polar m32 monitor and it arrived today. It looks pretty cool and it came with a free bike mount for the monitor watch.  I am very excited to try it.<\/p>\n<p>Even more exciting .. my iPod Shuffle has left Ontario, CA and is now in Memphis. Scheduled delivery is Monday evening (after I&#8217;ve left for Madison) but I have hope that it will be here tomorrow. Puh-leez FedEx, I beg you. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If I squint real hard I can pretend that this sugar-free hot chocolate that I&#8217;m drinking is the real deal.
