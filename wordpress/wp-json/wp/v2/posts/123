He was the most knowledgable fellow I&#8217;ve talked to and spent a good deal of time walking around the yard with us, pointing out which plants needed a different type of food, telling us the pros and cons of various mulches and other useful things like &#8220;oh &#8211; that&#8217;s poison sumac&#8221;. Which he pulled out after cutting the lawn on Monday.  I told him about the poison ivy incident from last summer and how I&#8217;d printed out information and pictures on The Internet but still couldn&#8217;t figure out what was good and what was bad. I pointed out to him the spot where I was pretty sure I&#8217;d gotten the poison ivy and he said &#8220;nope, it&#8217;s a weed&#8221; and pulled that out too. But 10 inches away from that was the woah, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got poison oak&#8221;. So now I know what poison oak looks like. And I&#8217;m not going to touch it on purpose.<br \/>\nSo of course I was pulling a few weeds on Sunday, even though I told myself I wouldn&#8217;t; behind weed number three was a bunch of poison oak. I definitely didn&#8217;t touch it directly but I have no way of knowing if there was any transfer via the weed. I was wearing gloves, I washed my hands thoroughly afterwards and even changed my clothes. Hoping for the best here. I can&#8217;t remember how long the incubation was from last summer. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is my last week in-in the office (working from MI next week) and I&#8217;m struggling to get things done or at least tidy before I go.
