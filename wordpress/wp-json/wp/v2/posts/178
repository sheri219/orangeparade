The eggplant went into a delicious pasta dish made with whole wheat rotelli, tomato sauce, diced eggplant , garlic scapes, and some zucchini from last week. The spinach and beet greens made for a delightful fritatta. We got a few salads out of the lettuce and the cukes topped sandwiches and made for good snacks. The pattypan squash was very good steamed in the microwave along with the mini onions.<\/p>\n<p>My mom was visiting last week and we discovered that beets are delightful when cooked in the microwave. It couldn&#8217;t be any easier. All you need to do is:<br \/>\nwash the beets and trim the greens to about an inch above the top<br \/>\nput the beets in a microwaveable container and cover with a lid<br \/>\nmicrowave on high for 8 minutes<br \/>\nlet the beets sit in the microwave for 5 minutes<br \/>\nif the beets are small, they might be done at this point. Take the beets out of the microwave and check them (poke with finger). If they&#8217;re not done, microwave for 3 minutes more and then let them sit in the microwave for 10 minutes.<br \/>\nPeel and eat or chill.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1054233929\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1141\/1054233929_74eac2a344.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"IMG_1056\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>peaches<br \/>\n+nectarines<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\nsuper delicious<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week (and the beginning of this week) was very busy and I just wasn&#8217;t able to get the details of week 8 up.
