I&#8217;ve made a few different loaves and they&#8217;ve all been pretty delicious. It&#8217;s a great way to use up odds and ends in your pantry, too. Today&#8217;s loaf included black beans, carrots, shallot, garlic, wheat germ, cooked oatmeal, soy sauce, tomato paste, mustard, and a variety of spices. The neat thing about throwing the vegan loaf together is that you can taste it before you bake it, unlike meat or egg-based loaves. <\/p>\n<p>Moving on to dessert. I rolled out the crust and put it in the pie dish. So pretty before baking!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3008933929\/\" title=\"Apple Pie by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3279\/3008933929_87f6216323.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Apple Pie\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>How was that for foreshadowing? Imagine my dismay when I opened the oven after 8 minutes and found that the pie crust had slipped down from the rim in some sections. Goodbye pretty crimps! Oh well. I forged ahead with apples (a mix of Mutsu, Cameo, and Fuji apples from last week&#8217;s CSA share) brown sugar, and a crumble topping. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3008934363\/\" title=\"Apple Pie by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3240\/3008934363_c0a449f9ac.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Apple Pie\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The pie baked for about an hour at 350.
