Exciting! The freezer is in decent shape but hopefully we can polish off a bit more before the cookable &#038; freezable veggies start arriving. <\/p>\n<p>I enjoy gardening. Even though the CSA provides more food than we can actually eat (hence the freezer) I grow a nice chunk of veggies &#038; herbs myself. This year is a little more intense than last year.  In the good name of &#8216;crop rotation&#8217; I decided to plant tomatoes in pots this year. Since I was going to plant a couple of pots, the reasoning went something like &#8220;well why don&#8217;t I just plant a bunch of pots?&#8221;<br \/>\nI found a couple of really pretty large terracotta pots with wooden stands at Crate &#038; Barrel when we were up in Cambridge over Memorial weekend. I already had two large plastic terracotta-colored pots, a long green windowbox, and an assortment of smaller pots. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not so great at planning ahead when it comes to my garden. If I was, I would start leafing through the seed catalogs in February and I&#8217;d order things well in advance. Instead, I go to a nursery and buy whatever they happen to have once the weather gets nice enough to plant. I cleared a bit of the patch and planted some peas mid-May, before we went to Japan. The rest went in June 1.  I went shopping in the morning and planted in the afternoon. Of course, I got a little carried away at the nursery and bought more tomato plants than I was planning on. A couple of them had to go in the garden but I put them in different spots than I usually do. Here&#8217;s what we have: 8 tomato plants, 1 eggplant, 4 cucumbers, peas, mint, cilantro, thyme, sage, chives, arugula, dill, eucalyptus, basil, and a few pretty annuals. Some are on the &#8220;upstairs&#8221; deck in pots and some are in the garden.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2545469404\/\" title=\"Before by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3110\/2545469404_9f12e2d612.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Before\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>after!<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2544644647\/\" title=\"plants! by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3065\/2544644647_9993d42dc0.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"plants!\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I need to take some progress pictures and a few shots of the &#8220;downstairs&#8221; garden.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The CSA starts in one week.
