I&#8217;ve also dreamed up an eggplant parm-ish pasta and if I end up making it, I will definitely post about it. We&#8217;re getting more eggplant this week so it&#8217;s definitely possible.<br \/>\nI made gazpacho yesterday with one of the onions, a pepper, the tomato, and cukes from my garden.  The boothby blonde cucumbers were gone the first night. They&#8217;re a perfect snack size. I also made a fantastic basil vinaigrette with the bunch of basil, plus some more from my garden.  Here&#8217;s the recipe:<br \/>\nBASIL VINAIGRETTE<br \/>\n1 garlic scape<br \/>\n1\/4 medium onion<br \/>\n2 Tbsp Dijon mustard<br \/>\n1\/4 lb basil<br \/>\n1\/2 cup apple cider vinegar<br \/>\n3\/4 cup canola oil<br \/>\n1\/4 cup olive oil<br \/>\n1\/4 cup orange juice<br \/>\nsalt and pepper<\/p>\n<p>Place all ingredients in order in blender and process. Makes approximately 1 pint.<\/p>\n<p>Last night I made a feta and tomato salad with the sungold cherry tomatoes, some grape tomatoes and basil from my garden, parsley from the farmer&#8217;s market (I never got around to starting parsley from seed this year). We also ate the whole pound of green beans, lightly steamed. They were very good on their own and I really liked them with a bit of the vinaigrette from the tomato salad. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was unable to take a picture for week 6 and we were out of town for week 7.
