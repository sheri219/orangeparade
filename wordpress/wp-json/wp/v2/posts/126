For those of you who are unfamiliar with Mr. Bento, it&#8217;s an insulated lunch container made by Zojirushi. It holds 4 containers of varying sizes and functionality: a &#8220;soup&#8221; bowl, a &#8220;rice&#8221; bowl, a medium-sized bowl and a small bowl. It keeps cold foods very cold and theoretically it keeps hot foods very hot. I haven&#8217;t felt like eating a hot meal as of late. It also comes with chopsticks in a little case. Awesome.<br \/>\nThe past couple of days I&#8217;ve been taking a salad of cold buckwheat noodles with peppers, edamame and a lemon-tahini dressing as my main course. The rest of the items I&#8217;ve changed up. I&#8217;ve taken cold lentil soup, carrots and hummus, cucumber slices, laughing cow cheese, cottage cheese or frozen mango chunks. It&#8217;s pretty fun and it&#8217;s nice having a good, tasty lunch every day.  And I&#8217;m not the only one. Flickr has a group for Mr. Bento devotees and I&#8217;ve started posting (though for some reason my pictures aren&#8217;t showing up when I&#8217;m not signed in). I didn&#8217;t take a picture of my lunch on Monday but I did yesterday and today, so if you&#8217;re interested in my lunch, you can take a look <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/sets\/72157594164629238\/\">here<\/a>.
