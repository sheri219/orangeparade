We were still recovering from having leftover veggies from the week before, a hazard of going out of town during CSA time. There&#8217;s a little lettuce left, the sorrel, the mustard greens, some of the scallions, and some of the basil. I haven&#8217;t yet used the beets, they&#8217;re very small, but I did use the beet greens and the perpetual spinach for &#8220;Spanokopita Greens&#8221; on Friday night, which I served alongside gnocchi with garlic scape pesto. The lettuce has gone in to many different salads. Tonight I&#8217;m planning to make pasta with all the herbs I have in the fridge and maybe the sorrel. I should steam up the beets tonight too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8230;Just in time for week 4. Yeah, I have some catching up to do.
