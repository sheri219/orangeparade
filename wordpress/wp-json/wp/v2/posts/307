A couple of orders ago, I got a free <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kingarthurflour.com\/shop\/items\/cream-tea-scone-mix\" target=_blank>Cream Tea Scone Mix<\/a> for ordering more than $50 or $60 worth of stuff. The mix sat on my shelf for awhile, as I&#8217;m not a big mix person or a big scone person. Finally, I made them at xmas time when Jodie and Ian came to visit. They were nothing short of fantastic. Delicious, moist, light-textured. No trace of the sawdust doorstops so many scones are. I&#8217;d been dreaming of ways to replicate them, since a $7 mix can&#8217;t be a staple in my house. <\/p>\n<p>I found a recipe for Cream Scones with Currants in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0936184752?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=orangeparade-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0936184752\" target=_blank>Baking Illustrated<\/a><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=orangeparade-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0936184752\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/> Here&#8217;s the recipe with my modifications.<\/p>\n<p>Cream Scones (no currants)<br \/>\n2 cups unbleached AP flour<br \/>\n1 Tbsp baking powder<br \/>\n3 Tbsp sugar<br \/>\n1\/2 tsp salt<br \/>\n5 Tbsp cold butter, cut in to cubes<br \/>\n1 C heavy cream<\/p>\n<p>Preheat your oven to 425F and set your rack in the middle of the oven.<br \/>\nPut flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in the workbowl of your food processor. Process with several 1-second pulses.<br \/>\nRemove the cover and distribute the butter evenly over the flour. Cover and process with 12 1-second pulses. Add in the heavy cream and do several short pulses until the dough begins to form.<br \/>\nTransfer the dough to a countertop and knead the dough by hand until it comes together into a rough, slightly sticky ball, 5 to 10 seconds. <\/p>\n<p>The original recipe says to cut the scones into 8 wedges. I wanted small, round scones so I used a biscuit cutter to cut them out. This was not a great plan. I should have added in some more flour when I was kneading or something, because they were a big sticky mess to cut out into rounds. Big sticky mess.  <\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3412171735\/\" title=\"Cream Scones by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3567\/3412171735_3a079c9169_o.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"164\" alt=\"Cream Scones\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3412171875\/\" title=\"Cream Scones by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3585\/3412171875_f24fdbb915_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Cream Scones\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>Place the scones on an ungreased baking sheet . If you have some pearl sugar, it makes a nice decoration on top. Bake until scone tops are light brown, 12-15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3412172011\/\" title=\"Cream Scones by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3567\/3412172011_03c3221578_o.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" alt=\"Cream Scones\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>They tasted great, were nice and light, but the dough wasn&#8217;t as easy to deal with as the Cream Tea Scone Mix dough. If I want scones that are easy to cut out, I&#8217;ll have to keep playing around a bit. I think I&#8217;ll give this recipe another try but I&#8217;ll go with the more standard triangle shape.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just so you don&#8217;t get any funny ideas, I don&#8217;t get any sort of promotional consideration from King Arthur Flour (though I wish I did&#8230; Hey &#8211; KA .. need me to test anything? \ud83d\ude42 I&#8217;d be delighted to&#8230;) I order flour and other things from King Arthur Flour fairly regularly.
