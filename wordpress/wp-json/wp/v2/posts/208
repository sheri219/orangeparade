The other new area of experimentation was in the oven. The small tin you see there was for boiling water. Many professional bread ovens have steam injection and I wanted to see what the effects of some moisture would have on the bread. They were many.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2393838581\/\" title=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2098\/2393838581_225a68ff2c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2394671398\/\" title=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat with caraway by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3229\/2394671398_6838b1d35b_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat with caraway\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>plain, before baking<\/td>\n<td>with caraway seeds, before baking<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2393839961\/\" title=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2016\/2393839961_229340af30.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Sourdough - Half white\/half whole wheat\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Big bread! The loaves definitely expanded more than they&#8217;ve been with pure dry heat.

When I got home I shaped the loaves for their final rise and baked later that afternoon. After an excruciating cooling period (I wanted to rip in to the bread as soon as I pulled it from the oven), we had panini sandwiches for dinner with the plain sourdough, fresh mozzarella, and homemade pesto from the freezer. Delicious. Thankfully there&#8217;s leftovers of all the ingredients so I might get another treat for dinner tonight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2394675522\/\" title=\"Mozzarella &amp; pesto panini by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2291\/2394675522_327b9e2823.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Mozzarella &amp; pesto panini\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>the dough the oven This week I tried my hand at half white\/half whole wheat sourdough bread.
