All is good. <\/p>\n<p>Last night I set up a new version of WordPress for our wedding website. Man, it is awesome. One of these days when I have a lot of time to deal with the fallout, I&#8217;ll update the version that I use for orangeparade. I highly recommend checking WordPress 1.5 out. <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve mentioned the insanity that is my garden. I think I&#8217;ve picked about 40 cucumbers so far. It&#8217;s a good thing we like to eat cucumbers and so do our neighbors and friends. I even brought a bunch back to Michigan this past weekend. I go out to the garden every other day or so and it seems like there&#8217;s always 5-10 new cucumbers to pick. Crazy! The tomatoes are just starting to ripen and the basil and parsley are going like gangbusters. The cilantro isn&#8217;t doing quite as well as most of it has been jumped by the cukes. I need to think of good things to do with large amounts of basil other than just make pesto. I already have a lot of pesto. If you have suggestions, please let me know. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had jury duty this morning and I was one of the last people to get dismissed, but dismissed I am so no need to serve for the next three years.
