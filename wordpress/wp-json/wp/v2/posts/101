It was a rainy and cold morning but Eric, Jeremie and I decided to head over there anyways. The shop was warm and charming and all of the gelato looked very good.

You won&#8217;t be sorry. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This may be some of the best gelato I&#8217;ve ever tasted.
