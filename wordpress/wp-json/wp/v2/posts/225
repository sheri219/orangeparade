Now we have only one head of lettuce in the fridge and I feel quite relieved. I also made angel hair pasta with olive oil, fresh basil, parsley, and summer savory. It was quite delicious. As for the rest of the veggies, there will need to be a big batch of asian coleslaw in our future. I think I&#8217;ll make roasted summer squash for dinner Friday night and then either some salad or sauteed greens, along with chicken soup and roast chicken.
