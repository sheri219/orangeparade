I took pictures of last week&#8217;s CSA share with Jeremie&#8217;s camera but I&#8217;m not quite sure where it&#8217;s hiding in the house. I took pictures of this week&#8217;s haul with my camera but I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of veggies and I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not very artfully arranged.

Holy cow. Last night I made garlicy kale with kale from last week, roasted a bunch of beets for the fridge &#038; freezer, roasted the turnips and also roasted some kohlrabi from a couple of weeks ago. We also tried to dry some peppers in our convection toaster oven but it was taking a really long time and I needed to go to bed, so I turned it off overnight. I should&#8217;ve just stayed up with it since I didn&#8217;t fall asleep until 3:30a anyway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I haven&#8217;t been writing (or taking many pictures) because I&#8217;ve been cooking.
