Here&#8217;s where it all went downhill.<br \/>\nI went to shul, though the drive took twice as long as it usually does. It was slippery, but not crazy. I left shul, got on the Merritt Parkway to go to work and traffic was moving along at about 2 miles\/hour. The parkway was a unique combination of parking lot and skating rink. Between Den Road and Long Ridge Road I was rear-ended (I&#8217;m fine) and between Long Ridge Road and High Ridge Road I almost spun out trying to drive up a hill. At that point I decided to give up and I got off the Merritt at High Ridge. Snow was still falling and even fancy AWD cars were having trouble. I parked myself at Starbucks and worked there for a couple of hours, until my laptop battery died. By that time traffic had thinned out and the city had started to plow and salt the roads, so I was able to drive home ok. Whew. <\/p>\n<p>I made a crustless pumpkin pie to console myself. It&#8217;s delicious. I think if I wanted to serve something like this to company, I&#8217;d bake it in custard cups rather than a pie plate, since without the crust it doesn&#8217;t cut up &#8220;pretty&#8221; but for just myself and the husband it&#8217;s perfectly fine.<\/p>\n<p>Crustless Pumpkin Pie<br \/>\n1 15 oz can pumpkin<br \/>\n1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk<br \/>\n2 eggs<br \/>\n1 tsp ground cinnamon<br \/>\n3\/4 tsp ground ginger<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp ground cloves<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp nutmeg<br \/>\n3\/4 C sugar<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp salt<\/p>\n<p>Grease a 9-inch pie dish or some number of custard cups\/ramekins. In a large bowl, beat two eggs with a whisk. Whisk in pumpkin, then add the sugar, salt, and spices. Slowly whisk in sweetened condensed milk. Pour mixture in to prepared pie dish.<\/p>\n<p>Baking: I baked this in my countertop convection oven at 300F for 40 minutes. If you&#8217;re going to do this in a regular oven, try 325F and see how it goes. It will probably take 40-50 minutes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What I thought I&#8217;d do today: get up, get dresssed, go to shul, go to work, blah blah blah.
