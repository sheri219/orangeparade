That is a lot of zucchini, to be more specific. Luckily they were a little smaller this week than in previous weeks, which helps to get through them a little more quickly. Thursday night I made yet another batch of chocolate chip zucchini bread and I&#8217;m no where near sick of it &#8211; it&#8217;s that good. <\/p>\n<p>To prove to you that I am indeed insane, I offer you this: I went to the farmers market on Thursday and bought tomatoes, parsley, carrots, bread, and cheese. I bought the parsley and tomatoes because I had all the nice cucumbers from the share and I&#8217;d been craving tabouli, which I made on Friday.  I also made some roasted zucchini for dinner Friday night. I pretty much had the day off from cooking on Saturday but Sunday afternoon it was nose to the grindstone again. I made ratatouille  (debated between <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/06\/13\/dining\/131rrex.html?ex=1185336000&#038;en=6bc6069dd9252441&#038;ei=5070\">Confit Byaldi<\/a> of Ratatouille (the movie) fame and a simpler oven-baked version, went with option 2) and &#8220;Spinach&#8221; pie. I put spinach in quotes because I used beet greens and swiss chard instead, stems included. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/everydayfood\/recipes\/Spinach_Pie.html\">recipe<\/a> I followed (mostly) was from the Everyday Food tv show. I wanted to give it a try because it doesn&#8217;t use quite as much fillo or butter as my regular recipe, which is for cocktail-sized spinach pies. It&#8217;s FANTASTIC, but making the individual triangles does take a lot of time and is a better winter project than a summer one.  Anyways, back to the everyday food recipe &#8211; I used half light feta and half regular feta and I don&#8217;t think the results were noticeable. I think the recipe calls for too much salt, given how salty feta usually is. If I make this again, I would definitely reduce the salt by a teaspoon or two.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mini Purplettes-1 bunch Summer Squash-16 Red Ace Beets-1 bunch with greens Bright Lights Swiss Chard-1 bunch Sage-1 bunch Cukes-4 Orient Express Eggplant-2 16 squash.
