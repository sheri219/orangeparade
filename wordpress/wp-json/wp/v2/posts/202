Add the water and 3 cups of flour. Beat vigorously.  Cover this sponge with plastic wrap and put it aside to work. The period can be very flexible, but allow at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. A longer period at a lower temperature will result in a more sour flavor.  &#8211; This is very true. Longer sitting == much better flavor, if the sour bit is really what you&#8217;re after.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2267518583\/\" title=\"&quot;The Sponge&quot; by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2410\/2267518583_cee008354a_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"&quot;The Sponge&quot;\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2268307058\/\" title=\"Batch 1 in the mixer by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2148\/2268307058_1f7b370cd2_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Batch 1 in the mixer\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>After the dough has bubbled and expanded, remove the plastic wrap.

For batch 2, I tried a different recipe: Sourdough Bread with Yeast. I was so excited that I forgot to take pictures while I was making it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2268370598\/\" title=\"Whole Wheat Sourdough by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2232\/2268370598_624cc99c53.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Whole Wheat Sourdough\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sourdough Bread with Yeast &#8211; also from King Arthur Flour<\/strong><br \/>\n9 ounces &#8220;fed&#8221; sourdough starter<br \/>\n12 ounces lukewarm water (you may need more with Whole Wheat flour)<br \/>\n1 T sugar<br \/>\n2 t instant yeast<br \/>\n5.5 to 6.5 cups AP flour (I used 5 cups of Whole Wheat)<br \/>\n1 T salt<br \/>\ncornmeal for sprinkling on baking pans<\/p>\n<p>Combine all of the ingredients, using only 5 cups of the flour.

Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Yield: 2 loaves.<\/p>\n<p>This made a tasty bread with a dense crumb and very few holes, and a very faint sourdough flavor. It&#8217;s good, but I don&#8217;t know that I would have recognized it as a sourdough bread. My educated guess is that the limited sourdough-ness of this recipe is due to the lack of the sponge phase and not because of the whole wheat flour. I need to try the first recipe with whole wheat flour to be sure.<\/p>\n<p>I took some of these breads in to work so that my friends could try it and I took the rest of it to GR last weekend for the fam to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>This past Friday we had a good snowstorm, which meant a work from home day. Since I work on my laptop in the kitchen, I couldn&#8217;t resist throwing another batch of Classic Sourdough together. This time I didn&#8217;t let the sponge phase last very long, only about 3 hours, because I wanted to have the bread finished in time for dinner. The whole process took about 9 hours, from beginning the sponge to pulling it out of the oven. I also decided to make one big loaf rather than two smaller loaves. The end result was a bread with an excellent, light crumb, ample holes, and a mild sour flavor. The large size was definitely impressive looking and I would do it again, especially if we were having other people over for dinner. <\/p>\n<p>Of course I forgot to take a picture. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been so in to the baking part of this whole sourdough extravaganza, that I haven&#8217;t wanted to take time to post about it!
