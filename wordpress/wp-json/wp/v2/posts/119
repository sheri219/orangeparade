Coke Blak is a &#8220;carbonated fusion beverage&#8221; and is supposed to taste like a mix of regular Coke and iced coffee. Upon opening the bottle, I was met with the distinct aroma of International Foods coffee (think &#8220;that waiter.. Jean-Luc!&#8221;) and 10 minutes later that&#8217;s pretty much what&#8217;s on my tongue &#8211; faky vanilla cappuccino. Going down, it&#8217;s a tasty beverage with good mouth feel. It&#8217;s definitely a soda but less carbonated than standard Coke varieties.<br \/>\nThe verdict? Eh. It&#8217;s not awful, but I can&#8217;t imagine anyone buying it more than once.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The latest from the I Tried It (so you don&#8217;t have to) files: Coca-Cola Blak.
