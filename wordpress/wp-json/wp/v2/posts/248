Why did they have to concentrate these activities in November? Is it the N? November is such a busy month. What about March? There&#8217;s nothing major going on in March. <\/p>\n<p>I had every intention of doing NaNoWriMo this time around, but with my travel schedule this month it seems unlikely that I&#8217;d be able to write 50,000 words by the end. Maybe NaBloPoMo is more realistic. Sadly, that means I should have posted yesterday. We&#8217;ll see how much progress I make on either one of these projects. I&#8217;m also getting back in to running. Maybe November *is* the month for ambitions or ambitious projects after all.<\/p>\n<p>This morning I woke up early (thanks, fall back day!), went running at the gym, and spent the rest of the day cooking and baking, rather than writing. Here&#8217;s what I made today: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/10\/19\/dining\/191mrex.html\">socca<\/a>, two loaves of cracked wheat bread, five dozen chocolate chip cookies, one pumpkin pie, and pressure cooker brown rice &#8220;breakfast pudding&#8221;.  Photos and recipes to come this week. I will say that while everything is delicious, I&#8217;m particularly proud of the bread and the pumpkin pie. I tried a new pie crust recipe (easy, will share) and a new filling recipe (also easy) and it was definitely a success. I accidentally left an ingredient out of the filling and it was still delicious (no, it wasn&#8217;t the pumpkin).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>November is the month for NaNoWriMo, National Novel Writing Month, and NaBloPoMo, National Blog Posting Month.
