First off &#8211; sourdough! We planned to have hot dogs Saturday night for dinner and I wanted to see how sourdough would work for hot dog buns. I finished the sourdough dough with 2+ cups of whole wheat flour, for about a 60\/40 white\/whole wheat split. Half the dough went towards the rolls and the other half became cheddar pepper sourdough. When it was time for the final shaping of the bread, I stretched it out into a rectangle and sprinkled it with cheddar and fresh cracked pepper. I rolled it up like a jelly roll and then let it finish rising in the brotform. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2544641319\/\" title=\"sourdough rolls by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3146\/2544641319_c5b3b47d19_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"sourdough rolls\" \/><\/a>   <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2544641167\/\" title=\"cheddar pepper sourdough by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3148\/2544641167_a1c5a89bbc_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"cheddar pepper sourdough\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The cheddar pepper is sticking its tongue out at you.<\/p>\n<p>Once that was done, I went on to Challah! I tried the recipe from a new book in my collection, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSecrets-Jewish-Baker-Recipes-Breads%2Fdp%2F1580088449%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1212422227%26sr%3D8-2&#038;tag=orangeparade-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325\">Secrets of a Jewish Baker<\/a><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=orangeparade-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/>. It&#8217;s very interesting in that it gives each recipe with three possible modifications for making the dough: by hand, in the food processor, or in a heavy duty stand mixer. The author recommends the heavy duty stand mixer and luckily, I have a good one. The stand mixer modifications end up making more dough than the standard recipe, so instead of two breads it yields three. I have little use for three challahs in one Shabbat and we usually struggle to make it through even one standard size challah, so I decided to make 6 &#8220;small&#8221; challahs (they weren&#8217;t *that* small). I froze 4 of them and baked off two. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/2544640671\/\" title=\"unbaked challahs by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3114\/2544640671_c750aebe41.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"unbaked challahs\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, I tried the &#8216;6 Strand Braid&#8217; for two of the challahs. My 6 strand technique needs work.

Eggy but not too eggy, sweet but not too sweet. The sourdough rolls were good, but a little too hard on the inside to be a perfect hot dog bun. Perhaps I&#8217;ll try them again using only white flour to see if that makes a difference.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thursday night I started a white sourdough sponge.
