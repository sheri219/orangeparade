It was a nice ride but a little nerve-wracking, because my laptop doesn&#8217;t fit in my new top-case as well as I thought it did. I&#8217;ll need to keep working on this.

Supposedly there will be a screening of Kill Bill2 at Jose&#8217;s tonight but we&#8217;ll see. <\/p>\n<p>Nothing much planned for the weekend and that&#8217;s just the way I like it.

I&#8217;ll be moving that one myself, guys. Thank goodness the stickers are not very sticky or I would have been, shall we say, upset.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I rode the Vespa to work today because I know my opportunities to do so will be limited once our office moves to Norwalk in a week.
