On Wednesday, I went to collect the share and put my box down on the floor, as I usually do. I picked out some squash and put them in my box. I picked out some carrots and put them in my box. Same actions repeated with daikon, collards, shallots, etc. I had everything in my box and when I went to pick it up, I noticed that there was an extra daikon in my box. I thought that was very strange. One of the people working the shift said something about maybe someone confused it with the swap box. I didn&#8217;t think anything of it and I put the daikon back in the daikon pile. <\/p>\n<p>When I got home, I unpacked everything and laid things out on the counter so that I could take a photo. It didn&#8217;t look right. It looked like I was missing something. Why? Because I was! If I&#8217;m giving the benefit of the doubt, then indeed, someone confused my box with the swap box (which is a large blue plastic laundry hamper, so how did that happen?) and I had no yellow carrots. I was wracked with anger and torment. I really wanted the carrots because a) I&#8217;ve never had yellow carrots, and b)I was planning to roast the yellow carrots with some orange carrots for a pretty dish. I&#8217;m pretty sure someone must have seen this swapping take place. Couldn&#8217;t they have said something to stop the person or warn me? <\/p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t certain that if I did go back downtown, that there&#8217;d be any carrots left. Usually there&#8217;s just enough of each veg for every share. Bill smartly pointed out that I would make myself crazy if I didn&#8217;t go check, so I hopped in the car and quickly made my way back to the pickup site, as it was almost closing time. There were quite a few shares that hadn&#8217;t been picked up yet, so there were plenty of carrots and I was able to get my bunch after all. In case you&#8217;re wondering, if there are any shares left at the end of the day, they go to our charity partner.<\/p>\n<p>And now, here&#8217;s the share for week 17.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1490551726\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1319\/1490551726_7216761647.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"2007 CSA Week 17 - veg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Acorn Winter Squash-2<br \/>\nCarnival Winter Squash-1<br \/>\nYellow Carrots-1 bunch<br \/>\nCauliflower-1 head<br \/>\nCollard Greens-1 bunch<br \/>\nDiakon Radish-1<br \/>\nShallots-3<br \/>\nApple Mint-1 bunch<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/1490551882\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1320\/1490551882_40046f3bb1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"2007 CSA Week 17 - fruit\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Anjou Pears<br \/>\nHoney Crisp, Cortland, Macoun Apples<br \/>\nraspberries <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have a large cardboard box with a bunch of plastic bags in it that I use every week when picking up my CSA share.
