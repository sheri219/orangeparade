Not wanting to just eat a big bowl of frosting, I thought I&#8217;d try to make some chocolate cookies.

Not terribly scientific, but I&#8217;d estimate about 2 cups. I baked the cookies at 350 for 12 minutes and they turned out, well, pretty darn perfect. They didn&#8217;t spread and they puffed up nicely. Since our house is a little long on baked goods right now, almost all of the cookies went in to the freezer. Once we&#8217;ve eaten through them, I&#8217;ll try to make them again and put together an actual recipe. <\/p>\n<p>Three cheers for not wasting butter!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I hate wasting food.
