I enjoyed making fresh pasta, but it was always kind of a pain dealing with the long sheets of dough in one hand and trying to crank the pasta roller with the other hand. I probably made fresh pasta 5 or 10 times, until one day in college I got the bright idea to use my pasta roller on some fimo clay and that was the end of that. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get fimo clay out of a pasta roller.<br \/>\nI&#8217;d had my eye on the pasta roller attachment for the Kitchen Aid mixer for a long time. After I got married and had a couple of Macy&#8217;s gift cards burning a hole in my pocket, I bought the set. And then it sat on my shelf for 6 months. Or maybe longer. Ok, longer. You got me. In my head it seemed like fresh pasta was going to be this huge messy project, a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of thing. Well let me tell you, it was easy and not at all messy. Here&#8217;s the dough recipe:<\/p>\n<p>Pepper Pasta<br \/>\n2 eggs<br \/>\n2 1\/4 C King Arthur Unbleached AP flour<br \/>\n2 Tbsp water<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp salt<br \/>\nlots of fresh ground pepper (I didn&#8217;t measure it)<\/p>\n<p>Combine all ingredients in the workbowl of your mixer and mix together using the paddle blade. Once a dough forms, switch to the dough hook and knead for a couple of minutes. Form the dough in to a ball. You may want to knead by hand for an additional minute or two. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.<br \/>\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and salt the water once it&#8217;s boiling. Don&#8217;t salt the water before it boils or you&#8217;ll pit your pots. Seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Set up the roller attachment on your KA mixer. Divide the dough in half. Roll one ball through on the largest setting, folding the dough and re-rolling 6 or 7 times. Once you have a smooth sheet, move the setting 1 notch smaller. Only roll the sheet through once per notch. Keep rolling on smaller settings until you have the thickness you desire. (I like it thin, 5 or 6). Let the sheet rest and roll out the other sheet. <\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3413059968\/\" title=\"Homemade Pasta by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3361\/3413059968_f5425690b8_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Homemade Pasta\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3413060064\/\" title=\"Homemade Pasta by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3617\/3413060064_79756804d0_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Homemade Pasta\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3413069916\/\" title=\"Homemade Pasta by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3341\/3413069916_fed017c2c6_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"181\" alt=\"Homemade Pasta\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3413060302\/\" title=\"Homemade Pasta by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3644\/3413060302_5b290b462c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Homemade Pasta\" \/><\/a>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>Once both sheets were done, I used the fettuccine cutter to cut the pasta. I recently read a recipe that recommended letting the sheets rest for 15 minutes between rolling and cutting. I&#8217;ll have to give that a try next time. Once the pasta is cut, boil it off. It only takes 4 minutes or so to cook, so if you&#8217;re planning on having any sauce with your pasta, have it ready before you put the pasta in the water. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Way back in high school I got a hand-crank pasta roller and cutter set.
