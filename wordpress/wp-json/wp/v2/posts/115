Yes, it was a lot of snow but p.s. the world did not end. Saturday we were in NYC for the day and the snow started to fall around 3p but it didn&#8217;t begin to stick until around 7 or so. We made it back to CT in plenty of time and even had a nice dinner before the heavy snowfall began. When we woke up in the morning there was about 8-10 inches of fluff on the ground. The TV told us that we hadn&#8217;t seen the worst of it yet and they were right. By the time the snow stopped falling at 4pm, there was another 10-14 inches of snow. Watching it pile up on the deck furniture was pretty darn entertaining. I took a bunch of pictures but I haven&#8217;t looked at any of them yet.<br \/>\nOnce the snow stopped, I bundled up and went out to shovel. I was the first on the block to go out and the expanse of snow made it very difficult to tell where our sidewalk was. I shoveled the first step and the second step; I was ready to continue on but I couldn&#8217;t figure out why my shovel wouldn&#8217;t go down the whole way. Then it hit me: there was another step to be shoveled. Once I hit sidewalk level it was hysterically obvious just how much snow we&#8217;d gotten. It came up to about three inches above my knee, which measures at about 22 inches. I think that&#8217;s the most snow I&#8217;ve ever seen out of one snowfall.<br \/>\nIt took about an hour and a half for Jeremie and I to shovel the walkway, the sidewalk, the driveway and the sidewalk and walkway of a nice old lady down the block.  Stupidly, I wore jeans to shovel and when I came in they were totally solked and my skin was bright red with white patches. Thankfully I didn&#8217;t have to amputate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This past weekend we got bopped by a major nor-easter, or if you&#8217;re watching the news, OMG IT&#8217;S THE BLIZZARD OF 2006.
