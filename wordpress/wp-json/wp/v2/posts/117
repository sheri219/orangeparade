I booked our honeymoon tickets a couple of months ago and since I was using miles to upgrade, my flight options were limited (there&#8217;s only a couple upgrade seats per flight).   I&#8217;d resigned myself to the fact that our route was a wee bit longer and more convoluted than it needed to be. Today I checked our reservation because it was time to get seat selection for the way home and I noticed that 5 out of 7 of our flights had changed schedules and due to the quick connection times the system wouldn&#8217;t let me reconfirm the reservation. Worried, I called the Gold\/Platinum reservations hotline and ended up with the nicest reservationist I&#8217;ve ever talked to.  She was able to rework our reservation to get clearance for the connection times on the way back, and AND AND get us on a direct flight from Minneapolis. Which gets us on a DC-10 instead of a 757-300.  Which gets us World Business Class seats.  I&#8217;m so excited.  We still have the 757 on the way back but I can totally handle that.  Northwest, today I&#8217;m a big fan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My crazy mileage run and Northwest Gold Elite status paid off today.
