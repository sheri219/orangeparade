I wanted to make a nice birthday treat for Jeremie to have with his friends at the office but I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make. At first I was thinking layer cake, but I thought it would need to feed a lot of people and making a big enough cake would be difficult to transport. Who knew that we&#8217;d have a snowstorm on March 1? So then I started thinking about cupcakes. The one downside of cupcakes, in my thinking, is that there&#8217;s no great way to write &#8220;Happy Birthday Jeremie&#8221; on them.  Then a couple of days ago, the little cookie idea came to me. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/3322987356\/\" title=\"Jeremie's Birthday cupcakes by sheri219, on Flickr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3607\/3322987356_2bcd663094.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" alt=\"Jeremie's Birthday cupcakes\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I was going to make a yellow cake recipe from Baking Illustrated, but there were two things about it that I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about: 1) it calls for a lot of butter, and 2) the recipe only makes 12 cupcakes and I didn&#8217;t want to double it, never having made this recipe. A last minute conversation with Jodie steered me towards <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0307396444?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=orangeparade-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0307396444\">Martha Stewart&#8217;s Cooking School: Lessons and Recipes for the Home Cook<\/a><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=orangeparade-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0307396444\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/> which I had forgotten to check for a recipe. I decided to go with her yellow butter cake recipe. It made 42 cupcakes, which is a lot, but we brought about 30 in to the office and I can pop the rest in the freezer.  I used Martha&#8217;s recipe for easy chocolate buttercream, but I used more cocoa and about a tablespoon of heavy cream to help it all come together. I baked the cupcakes the day before but I didn&#8217;t pipe the frosting on until just before leaving the house.<\/p>\n<p>For the little cookies, I used my Mom&#8217;s recipe for Hanukkah cookies, a tried and true winner when you need a frostable cookie. <\/p>\n<p>Frostable (Hanukkah) Cookies<br \/>\n1 cup sugar<br \/>\n1\/4 cup butter<br \/>\n1\/4 cup vegetable shortening<br \/>\n2 eggs<br \/>\n2 1\/2 cups flour<br \/>\n2 tsp. baking powder<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp. salt<br \/>\n1 T. orange juice<br \/>\n1 tsp. vanilla<\/p>\n<p>Cream sugar and shortening.  Add eggs.  Beat.<br \/>\nAdd dry ingredients.  Add liquids.  If dough is a<br \/>\nlittle wet, add more flour.  Roll out on floured<br \/>\nboard. Bake at 375 for 6-10 minutes on ungreased cookie sheets.<br \/>\nMakes 5-6 dozen.<\/p>\n<p>Because I made such little circles, I baked at 350 for 5 minutes and I always use a silpat. <\/p>\n<p>Was this time consuming? Yes.<br \/>\nAre they delicious? Yes.<br \/>\nWorth it? Oh totally.<\/p>\n<p>A PSA: I realized I didn&#8217;t have enough powdered sugar for the frosting at 10:30 on a Sunday night in a snowstorm. Not good. I checked the internet and found several suggestions on how to make your own powdered sugar. The gist of the stories is: combine 1 cup of granulated sugar with 2 tablespoons of corn starch in a coffee grinder or food processor, whirl for a minute or so and voila, powdered sugar. Well, let me tell you, what I got was indeed powderier than granulated sugar but it sure wasn&#8217;t powdered sugar. I added some more cornstarch and whirled again, but no dice. I used it in making the buttercream frosting because I was out of options. The frosting was tasty but grainy, as you would expect when using granulated sugar. So, if you run out of powdered sugar I do not recommend trying to make your own at home. Maybe it would be passable if you&#8217;re making cookies or something baked, but it doesn&#8217;t cut it for frosting.<\/p>\n<p>That is what I get for not checking my staples. Now I&#8217;m out of granulated sugar.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I take birthdays very seriously.
