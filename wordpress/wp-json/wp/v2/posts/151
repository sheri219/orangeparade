Peeling a pumpkin is no easy task, but the end result was worth the effort. We ate some soup Saturday evening and my feeling was &#8220;it&#8217;s an ok soup&#8221;. A little time in the fridge did the the soup a world of good and it&#8217;s really very delicious now. Besides that, we&#8217;ve been eating our greens in a tasty, uncreative fashion.

Babbo! Guess who else was there? Gwyneth Paltrow. La di da. I was really looking forward to dinner and it did not disappoint; the food was fabulous. Ordering with 5 people was a challenge but it was good trying things I wouldn&#8217;t have normally ordered. On our waiter&#8217;s recommendation I went with the duck for my main course and it was the most incredible duck I&#8217;ve ever had. Perfumed with rosemary, it was tender where it should be tender and crisp where it should be crisp. The pastas, main course and dessert were all very good. The weakest spot, in my opinion, was the antipasti but even that was good. I&#8217;d definitely go back.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s unseasonably warm today and it&#8217;s so tempting to pop out of the office and go get some gelato.
