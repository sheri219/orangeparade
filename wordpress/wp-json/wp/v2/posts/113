I got a big cup&#8217;s worth and topped it off with a little regular milk (this blend scoffs at skim)&#8230; pure bliss. It&#8217;s strong, smoky and a bit bitter on its own but the small amount of milk rounds it out perfectly. So nice.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s been awhile since I posted; inertia is a hard thing to overcome. I&#8217;ve been busy these first few weeks of January. I took a trip to Minneapolis to visit the fam, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of wedding stuff in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time and last weekend we lost power for a day, due to a big storm. There are still people without power so I feel incredibly lucky to have been inconvienienced for such a short time in comparison. <\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, in-between the relaxing part and the storm part we tried a new place in South Norwalk: Chocopologie. Chocopologie is a cafe\/bakery\/chocolate shop. They have very good hours (M-W 7:30a &#8211; 10p, Thurs 7:30a &#8211; midnight, Fri 7:30a &#8211; 2a, Sat 9:30a &#8211; 2a and Sunday 10a &#8211; 6p) and fabulous food, desserts, coffee and hot chocolate at reasonable prices. There isn&#8217;t a website specific to the restaurant but it&#8217;s run by a chocolatier, Fritz Knipschildt and you can find a bit more information about him and his chocolates at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knipschildt.com\" target=_blank>Knipschildt Chocolatier<\/a>. Check it out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have a friend here at work who&#8217;s mom lives in Puerto Rico.
