I think the oven might have been a little hotter? Not sure. I also made black eyed pea hummus, tomato and feta salad, two batches of Chocolate Chip Zucchini bread, a triple batch of gazpacho for freezing, two chard and onion quiches, and tomatillo salsa. I followed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/TOMATILLO-SALSA-239969\" target=_blank>this recipe from Epicurious<\/a>, but I left out the serrano chili since I didn&#8217;t have one on hand. When the salsa finished cooking I thought it was delicious as-is, so I didn&#8217;t add the lime juice or cilantro.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The photo this week is a little different than most weeks.
