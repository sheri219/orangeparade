He&#8217;s a handsome little poodle and we&#8217;ve had a lot of fun so far. Yesterday we went to the farmer&#8217;s market in New Canaan and took a walk around town. We played and he napped a little in the afternoon and then we took a long walk in the evening. This morning I got up early, early, early and we took another long walk. <br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sheri219\/263809058\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/static.flickr.com\/82\/263809058_2dab6beb9b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Panko\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<br \/>\nLast night, Panko afoot, I realized that there&#8217;s no way we could eat all the luscious plums in the fridge so I decided to make Jeremie&#8217;s Mom&#8217;s plum cake.

I love dairy meals.  Later this morning we&#8217;re heading off to Forest Hills, Queens to meet up with some family and have brunch. Hopefully we&#8217;ll hit up some Kosher markets afterwords so we can stock up on el Kosher chicken. I can&#8217;t find kosher chicken wings around here. Can you believe it? Oh &#8211; ps &#8211; it&#8217;s yontev so no markets. Silly me.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe new countertops &#038; sink come on Tuesday. I&#8217;m very excited. I&#8217;m a little worried that I won&#8217;t be able to take good pictures on the counter anymore, but such is thus.\n<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re dog-sitting this weekend and I&#8217;m delighting in the company of one Mr. Panko.
