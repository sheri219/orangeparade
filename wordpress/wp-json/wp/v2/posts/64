I&#8217;m in town again for another round of Info Session &#038; Interviews. I expect it to be interesting as usual. As it looks like I&#8217;m on my own for dinner tonight, I&#8217;m thinking of trying an Ethiopian place or an Afghan place near where I&#8217;m staying. I&#8217;ll report back if it&#8217;s remarkable.  The Northwest Airline Angels were smiling on me today. I was supposed to have a 3 hour layover in Minneapolis but my flight from NY got in a little bit early and I noticed that the gate next to mine had a flight going to Madison 5 minutes later.

I half expect my friends to walk through the door. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone needs to remind me why I don&#8217;t live in a college town because I&#8217;ve forgotten the reason.
