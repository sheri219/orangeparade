Except for one thing &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t always work.<br \/>\nSometimes it turns on, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.  When it doesn&#8217;t turn on, I don&#8217;t get any battery status either. Sometimes I can get it to turn on if I play with the switch and press buttons in random order for 5-10 minutes. Sometimes I can get it to turn on if I &#8220;jump start&#8221; it by popping it in to the USB on the laptop. Other times, it won&#8217;t turn on (or be recognized by the computer), USB be damned.<br \/>\nFrustration with the shuffle had me to the point of tears one night. I asked the sky why must I be cursed with the bad shuffle? Jeremie&#8217;s consistently performs to perfection and I could not find evidence of similar problems online.<br \/>\nOut of ideas,  I visited the &#8220;Genius Bar&#8221; at my nearest Apple store last week Friday. As far as genius goes, it seemed to be rather hit or miss. The guy who helped me may or may not have been smart, but he sure just wasn&#8217;t nice. He treated me like I was crazy.  I described to him the problems I was seeing and the first thing he does is try to turn it on.  It doesn&#8217;t turn on and the battery status light stays dark. He snottily says to me &#8220;oh, of course it doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s not charged&#8221; and I was like &#8220;uh, yeah, that was the problem I was telling you about&#8221; while I was thinking &#8220;yeah, thanks assclown&#8221;.  Then he popped it into a mac, did a restore and was able to get it to turn on.  He said he wanted to keep the Shuffle for a few days to continue testing, but said it in a tone of voice clearly meant to convey to me that he thought I was nuts. <\/p>\n<p>Even Jeremie says that the guy was rather unkind to me. <\/p>\n<p>Today I checked the repair status online and it says &#8220;awaiting parts&#8221;. I find this very interesting. I&#8217;ll call tomorrow and see what&#8217;s up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to post about this for awhile now, but time has been scarce the past couple of weeks.
