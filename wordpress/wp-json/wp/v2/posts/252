Check.<br \/>\nOne can of evaporated milk? Oh. Well, no.<\/p>\n<p>I had a can of sweetened condensed milk in my pantry and I didn&#8217;t want to go to the store, so I poked around until I found a pumpkin pie recipe that called for sweetened condensed milk.<br \/>\nHere is my adaptation of the recipe.

Roll out the pie crust and fit into a 9 inch pie plate. You definitely want to use a deep dish pie plate, but my Emile Henry pie plate was almost *too* deep. Pierce crust all over with a fork. Bake the crust until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Cool crust on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>Whisk pumpkin, condensed milk, sour cream, and spices in large bowl to blend. (I used the whisk attachment on my mixer.) Whisk in eggs. <\/p>\n<p>Pour filling in to crust. Bake pie until filling is puffed around sides and set in the center, about 55 minutes. Cool pie on rack.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours, or if you&#8217;re impatient, eat a piece when the pie is still warm and then another piece later when it&#8217;s cool. It really does change when you let it cool and set.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One can of pumpkin? Check. One can of evaporated milk? Oh. Well, no.
