I didn&#8217;t really realize that it *was* December until Sunday, which was already December 2. Sunday turned into Monday, which turned into Tuesday and then Wednesday and still I didn&#8217;t feel like sitting down at my computer after a whole day of sitting down at my other computer. So here I am on Thursday, which is better than never, right?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Chanukah, so Happy Chanukah if that applies to you. I exercise at the Stamford JCC and they have a very nice Kosher bakery\/restaurant inside. Every day this week I&#8217;ve been tempted by the smell of latkes and soufganiyot (jelly doughnuts). I thought about buying a latke but I&#8217;m too cheap. I&#8217;ll make latkes this weekend, either Saturday night or Sunday. Lately, I&#8217;ve been running more often. I&#8217;ve been mixing in the Ok Go Treadmill Workout (found on iTunes &#8211; get it free if you join the Apple Students Facebook group). The music is good and it prompts you to do intervals. <\/p>\n<p>Last night I made an interesting rice pudding in the pressure cooker. No picture, but here&#8217;s the recipe that I adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreat-Vegetarian-Cooking-Under-Pressure%2Fdp%2F0688123260%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196971170%26sr%3D8-1&#038;tag=orangeparade-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325\">Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure<\/a><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=orangeparade-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Brown Rice Pudding<\/strong><br \/>\n1 C long grain brown or brown basmati rice<br \/>\n1\/3 C old fashioned oatmeal<br \/>\n10 oz apple juice<br \/>\n2 1\/2 C hot water<br \/>\n3\/4 t cinnamon<br \/>\n1\/4 C raisins<br \/>\nMix all ingredients in the pressure cooker and bring up to high pressure.

Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>I tasted a little last night after it was done and it was quite good. I think I&#8217;ll have some for breakfast tomorrow and I&#8217;ll see how well it reheats. I also made a batch of pressure cooker poached pears last night. Delicious, as always!
