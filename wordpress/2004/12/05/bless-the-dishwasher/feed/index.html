					<description><![CDATA[Your assumption was correct on the cookies.  My wife and I have been experimenting with cookies recently as well, and the colder the butter, the better for our cookies.  We prefer to just take sticks of butter right out of the fridge, and let the kitchenaid beat them into submission.  I suggest you try making them again, without &quot;melting&quot; the butter, perhaps merely softening it, or just out of the fridge like we do.

Alton Brown is the best.  Melting/softening the butter makes the flat spread out cookies.  Perhaps his notes/recipes were &quot;lost in translation&quot; ?]]></description>
