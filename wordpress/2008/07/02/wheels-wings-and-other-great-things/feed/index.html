					<description><![CDATA[So cool! Welcome, Deborah! 

A couple of days after we got home, his Mom called me and said that not only had he requested the book for story time every night, but that when he woke up one morning, he told his Dad that he was a Pout Pout Fish with a Pout Pout Face!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The downside of being a first-time author is the tendency to obsessively Google one&#039;s book title (to see if anyone other than one&#039;s mother is reading it).  The upside is, in the process, discovering sites and blogs one wouldn&#039;t have otherwise found.  Your mention of my book The Pout-Pout Fish brought me to your site (courtesy of Google), and I&#039;m very glad to have found it.  What fabulous loaves you bake!  I&#039;m not a baker myself, but my husband makes some spectacular breads, so I&#039;ve developed a taste for them.  I&#039;m also glad to read about your CSA experience.  My day job is at a nonprofit organization which, amongst other things, sponsors an urban Farmers&#039; Market.  So I&#039;m very glad to have discovered your blog, and I&#039;ll now be a regular reader.

Those cookies look terrific; and I&#039;m definitely giving the coffee ice cream recipe a try.

Incidentally, if your nephew might like some signed bookmarks or other Pout-Pout items (I have word puzzles, &quot;cootie catchers,&quot; and other stuff), feel free to be in touch and I&#039;d be glad to send some your way.
