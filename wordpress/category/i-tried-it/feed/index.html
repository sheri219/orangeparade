<p>In a word, yuck.</p>
<p>I like TJ&#8217;s plain Greek Style yogurt but the honey flavored cup is too sweet, too chalky, a little bitter and all around unpleasant. It really tastes twice as sweet as real honey and that&#8217;s not a good thing.  I&#8217;ve gotten through about a third of it and I don&#8217;t think I can choke down any more. For 120 calories in the 5.3 oz cup, it&#8217;s definitely not worth it. This product would be much better if it was mostly plain yogurt with a drizzle of honey on top.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;ve helped to save you a dollar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest from the I Tried It (so you don&#8217;t have to) files: Coca-Cola Blak.<br />
Why did I try it? I saw it in the cafeteria here at work and several things made it catch my eye:<br />
1. diminuitive 8 oz bottle &#8211; <em>glass</em> bottle<br />
2. only 45 calories, which while more than diet is much less than a can of regular Coke<br />
3. glass bottle!<br />
I&#8217;d been curious about it for several weeks, ever since I read a blurb about it on slashfood, so I jumped on the opportunity. Coke Blak is a &#8220;carbonated fusion beverage&#8221; and is supposed to taste like a mix of regular Coke and iced coffee. Upon opening the bottle, I was met with the distinct aroma of International Foods coffee (think &#8220;that waiter.. Jean-Luc!&#8221;) and 10 minutes later that&#8217;s pretty much what&#8217;s on my tongue &#8211; faky vanilla cappuccino. Going down, it&#8217;s a tasty beverage with good mouth feel. It&#8217;s definitely a soda but less carbonated than standard Coke varieties.<br />
The verdict? Eh. It&#8217;s not awful, but I can&#8217;t imagine anyone buying it more than once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a friend here at work who&#8217;s mom lives in Puerto Rico. She grows and roasts her own coffee and said friend always brings some back to be brewed at the office. This morning is Lucky Morning. I got a big cup&#8217;s worth and topped it off with a little regular milk (this blend scoffs at skim)&#8230; pure bliss. It&#8217;s strong, smoky and a bit bitter on its own but the small amount of milk rounds it out perfectly. So nice.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s been awhile since I posted; inertia is a hard thing to overcome. I&#8217;ve been busy these first few weeks of January. I took a trip to Minneapolis to visit the fam, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of wedding stuff in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time and last weekend we lost power for a day, due to a big storm. There are still people without power so I feel incredibly lucky to have been inconvienienced for such a short time in comparison. </p>
<p>Last weekend, in-between the relaxing part and the storm part we tried a new place in South Norwalk: Chocopologie. Chocopologie is a cafe/bakery/chocolate shop. They have very good hours (M-W 7:30a &#8211; 10p, Thurs 7:30a &#8211; midnight, Fri 7:30a &#8211; 2a, Sat 9:30a &#8211; 2a and Sunday 10a &#8211; 6p) and fabulous food, desserts, coffee and hot chocolate at reasonable prices. There isn&#8217;t a website specific to the restaurant but it&#8217;s run by a chocolatier, Fritz Knipschildt and you can find a bit more information about him and his chocolates at <a href="http://www.knipschildt.com" target=_blank>Knipschildt Chocolatier</a>. Check it out.</p>
