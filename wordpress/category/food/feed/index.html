										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What I thought I&#8217;d do today: get up, get dresssed, go to shul, go to work, blah blah blah.<br />
What really happened: I got up, got dressed, and as I was leaving the house I saw it was snowing. Here&#8217;s where it all went downhill.<br />
I went to shul, though the drive took twice as long as it usually does. It was slippery, but not crazy. I left shul, got on the Merritt Parkway to go to work and traffic was moving along at about 2 miles/hour. The parkway was a unique combination of parking lot and skating rink. Between Den Road and Long Ridge Road I was rear-ended (I&#8217;m fine) and between Long Ridge Road and High Ridge Road I almost spun out trying to drive up a hill. At that point I decided to give up and I got off the Merritt at High Ridge. Snow was still falling and even fancy AWD cars were having trouble. I parked myself at Starbucks and worked there for a couple of hours, until my laptop battery died. By that time traffic had thinned out and the city had started to plow and salt the roads, so I was able to drive home ok. Whew. </p>
<p>I made a crustless pumpkin pie to console myself. It&#8217;s delicious. I think if I wanted to serve something like this to company, I&#8217;d bake it in custard cups rather than a pie plate, since without the crust it doesn&#8217;t cut up &#8220;pretty&#8221; but for just myself and the husband it&#8217;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Crustless Pumpkin Pie<br />
1 15 oz can pumpkin<br />
1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />
3/4 tsp ground ginger<br />
1/4 tsp ground cloves<br />
1/4 tsp nutmeg<br />
3/4 C sugar<br />
1/4 tsp salt</p>
<p>Grease a 9-inch pie dish or some number of custard cups/ramekins. In a large bowl, beat two eggs with a whisk. Whisk in pumpkin, then add the sugar, salt, and spices. Slowly whisk in sweetened condensed milk. Pour mixture in to prepared pie dish.</p>
<p>Baking: I baked this in my countertop convection oven at 300F for 40 minutes. If you&#8217;re going to do this in a regular oven, try 325F and see how it goes. It will probably take 40-50 minutes.</p>

It was quite easy and now I have a batch of mix in my freezer. </p>

<p>I followed the King Arthur Whole-Grain Pancake Mix <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/RecipeDisplay?RID=68" target=_blank>recipe</a> almost exactly. I only had 60g of White Whole Wheat flour so used that, plus 420g of their 100% Organic Whole Wheat. My pancakes were a little darker than theirs but the taste shouldn&#8217;t be any different. Use what you have. These pancakes are delicious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eleven. </p>
<p>I picked eleven pounds of cucumber from my garden last night. My refrigerator is a wee bit ridiculous right now.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got in the share yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sheri219/2762987800/" title="2008 CSA Week 9 - Veg by sheri219, on Flickr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3282/2762987800_df8c553f54.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="2008 CSA Week 9 - Veg" /></a></p>
<p>Cucumbers-2<br />
Orient Express Eggplant-2<br />
*Walla Walla Onions-2<br />
Sun Gold Cherry Tomatoes-1 basket<br />
Slicing Tomatoes-1 1/2 pounds<br />
Gold Beets-1 bunch<br />
Lilac Peppers-2<br />
Cilantro-1 bunch<br />
*Fennel-1 head<br />
Summer Squash-2 pounds </p>
<p>Someone had put their onions in the swap box so I swapped out my fennel. Excellent trade in my book.</p>

<p>peaches<br />
nectarines<br />
donut peaches<br />
shiro plums </p>
<p>Last night I made chocolate chip zucchini bread with the zucchini. I made four mini loaves and two of them are definitely prettier than the other. I was not in a great mood. The kitchen was hot, it was late, and I should have been paying more attention. I tested one loaf and when it was done I pulled all the loaves out. The others could have used a few more minutes but it was too late by the time I noticed. Totally careless mistake. </p>
<p>For dinner we had chopped tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, <a href="http://www.maldonsalt.co.uk/">Maldon salt</a> (it&#8217;s large and crispy), a drizzle of olive oil, and fresh ground pepper. Delicious.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had big plans for these eggplant (<a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/EGGPLANT-ROLLS-FILLED-WITH-BASIL-AND-CHEESE-12755">eggplant roll-ups</a>) but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to making the recipe yet. I&#8217;ve also dreamed up an eggplant parm-ish pasta and if I end up making it, I will definitely post about it. We&#8217;re getting more eggplant this week so it&#8217;s definitely possible.<br />
I made gazpacho yesterday with one of the onions, a pepper, the tomato, and cukes from my garden.  The boothby blonde cucumbers were gone the first night. They&#8217;re a perfect snack size. I also made a fantastic basil vinaigrette with the bunch of basil, plus some more from my garden.  Here&#8217;s the recipe:<br />
BASIL VINAIGRETTE<br />
1 garlic scape<br />
1/4 medium onion<br />
2 Tbsp Dijon mustard<br />
1/4 lb basil<br />
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar<br />
3/4 cup canola oil<br />
1/4 cup olive oil<br />
1/4 cup orange juice<br />
salt and pepper</p>
<p>Place all ingredients in order in blender and process. Makes approximately 1 pint.</p>
<p>Last night I made a feta and tomato salad with the sungold cherry tomatoes, some grape tomatoes and basil from my garden, parsley from the farmer&#8217;s market (I never got around to starting parsley from seed this year). We also ate the whole pound of green beans, lightly steamed. They were very good on their own and I really liked them with a bit of the vinaigrette from the tomato salad. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday evening I picked 3.6 lbs of delicious Kirby cucumbers from my garden. I decided to take three of these tiny giants and make a jar of refrigerator pickles. In the past I&#8217;ve used smaller cukes and when left whole, they usually take about a week in the fridge to pickle. Since these were a bit larger, I cut them in spears and I expect they&#8217;ll be ready in a couple of days. All that&#8217;s in the jar is cucumbers, kosher salt, dill and water.</p>

cucumbers and dill, with salt and water</p>
<p>I really hope they turn out well!</p>
