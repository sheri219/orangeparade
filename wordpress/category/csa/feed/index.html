<p>I&#8217;ve had big plans for these eggplant (<a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/EGGPLANT-ROLLS-FILLED-WITH-BASIL-AND-CHEESE-12755">eggplant roll-ups</a>) but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to making the recipe yet. I&#8217;ve also dreamed up an eggplant parm-ish pasta and if I end up making it, I will definitely post about it. We&#8217;re getting more eggplant this week so it&#8217;s definitely possible.<br />
I made gazpacho yesterday with one of the onions, a pepper, the tomato, and cukes from my garden.  The boothby blonde cucumbers were gone the first night. They&#8217;re a perfect snack size. I also made a fantastic basil vinaigrette with the bunch of basil, plus some more from my garden.  Here&#8217;s the recipe:<br />
BASIL VINAIGRETTE<br />
1 garlic scape<br />
1/4 medium onion<br />
2 Tbsp Dijon mustard<br />
1/4 lb basil<br />
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar<br />
3/4 cup canola oil<br />
1/4 cup olive oil<br />
1/4 cup orange juice<br />
salt and pepper</p>
<p>Place all ingredients in order in blender and process. Makes approximately 1 pint.</p>
<p>Last night I made a feta and tomato salad with the sungold cherry tomatoes, some grape tomatoes and basil from my garden, parsley from the farmer&#8217;s market (I never got around to starting parsley from seed this year). We also ate the whole pound of green beans, lightly steamed. They were very good on their own and I really liked them with a bit of the vinaigrette from the tomato salad. </p>

(English Thyme-1 bunch)</p>
<p>Yesterday was my first Swap Box win of the season! There was one bunch of the Bright Lights Swiss Chard in there so I swapped it for my bunch of English Thyme, since I have thyme in my garden and I love the Swiss chard. </p>
<p>The Grand Rapids lettuce head was small this week and we polished that off last night along with the rest of last week&#8217;s romaine. Now we have only one head of lettuce in the fridge and I feel quite relieved. I also made angel hair pasta with olive oil, fresh basil, parsley, and summer savory. It was quite delicious. As for the rest of the veggies, there will need to be a big batch of asian coleslaw in our future. I think I&#8217;ll make roasted summer squash for dinner Friday night and then either some salad or sauteed greens, along with chicken soup and roast chicken. So many possibilities!</p>

It&#8217;s been busy at my house this past week and I just haven&#8217;t had time to do much more than get the photos off of my camera. And then try to eat vegetables as fast as we can. Lettuce, I love you but it&#8217;s getting to be a little much.</p>

Baby Red Ace Beets and Greens-1 bunch<br />
Genovese Basil-1 bunch<br />
Red Vein Sorrel-1 bunch</p>
<p>I did ok this week. We were still recovering from having leftover veggies from the week before, a hazard of going out of town during CSA time. There&#8217;s a little lettuce left, the sorrel, the mustard greens, some of the scallions, and some of the basil. I haven&#8217;t yet used the beets, they&#8217;re very small, but I did use the beet greens and the perpetual spinach for &#8220;Spanokopita Greens&#8221; on Friday night, which I served alongside gnocchi with garlic scape pesto. The lettuce has gone in to many different salads. Tonight I&#8217;m planning to make pasta with all the herbs I have in the fridge and maybe the sorrel. I should steam up the beets tonight too.</p>

<p>Things are still pretty green this week. I asked the Magic 8 Ball and the outlook is good for salads. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to do with the summer savory. It smells fantastic so I&#8217;ll have to hunt up something good. There&#8217;s definitely more garlic scape pesto in my future. Mmm.</p>
